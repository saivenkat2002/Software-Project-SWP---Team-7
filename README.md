# Software-Project-SWP---Team-7
Our Goal is to Develop a software application to track project activity and time spent on the project. Individual team members can record the time and type of activities they carried out. Additionally, the application provides analysis functionality to evaluate the overall time spent on a certain type of activity with regard to various criteria.
